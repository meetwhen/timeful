# Design Records

This directory is the canonical record of durable Timeful design decisions.
Design records describe architectural choices that constrain implementation, while requirements specify outcomes.

## Layout

- `architecture/README.md` contains architecture-decision-record authoring
  guidance.
- `architecture/adr/` contains architecture decision records (ADRs).
- Future design-record categories belong in their own subdirectory and are
  indexed here.

## Related Artifacts

- Functional requirements (FRs) state required system behavior.
- Quality requirements (QRs) state required quality attributes or runtime
  constraints.
- Specifications (SPECs) describe a feature or domain in broader context and
  may link to multiple requirements.
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) record architectural decisions.
- ADRs may link to the FRs and QRs that they enable, constrain, or satisfy.
  FRs and QRs remain self-contained specifications and must not cite ADRs as
  normative dependencies.
  Requirement provenance is recorded separately from
  the requirement statement.
- Backlog tasks track work to investigate, implement, or verify requirements.
