Semi-structured TODO list

- [ ] Don't mention "legacy" in the code
- [ ] Add adr about using vue 3 and vuetify
- [ ] Speed up eslint and reduce memory consumption from 11GB
- [ ] remove `as unknown as`
- [ ] add eslint rule for `as unknown`
- [ ] is `$el` idiomatic modern syntax?
- [ ] add Playwright e2e tests from the comparator to the main repository
- [ ] commit comparator code to the main repository until it works as expected
- [ ] Check against composition API
- [ ] Use the right palette consistently for dropdowns, selects, buttons, switches
- [ ] use clean layout-based fixes
- [ ] avoid !important
- [ ] make a design system
- [ ] why is the button not blocked when none of the dates is selected
- [ ] refactoring - get rid of duplication
- [ ] add more instrumentation?
- [ ] don't modify vuetify internals (deep)
- [ ] load all routes lazily
- [ ] adr - add README that explains the ADR format
  - [ ] Add "Scope" - frontend, backend?
- [ ] adr - backend handles only particular paths for initial HTML with essential metadata
  - [ ] Scope: frontend, backend
- [ ] use the same node for frontend in dockerfile and in dev
- [ ] move hardcoded values to env vars in compose
- [ ] Check whether NODE_ENV and GIN_MODE are in the example .env files
- [ ] introduce staging environment
- [ ] make more functions for business logic pure
- [ ] Get rid of eslint-disable-*
  - [ ] `eslint-disable vue/one-component-per-file`
- [ ] event creator can edit other's availabilities (less probability that both guest event creator and guest clear both cookies and localstorage)?
- [ ] optional password for restoring. edit own responses and open for editing, can click the lock button to enter password and edit others' responses
- [ ] edit button always visible
- [ ] add description if initial event description is empty
- [ ] the selection box overlaps vertical lines on the left at the border of a grid of subsequent dates
- [ ] add instructions for the agent to write scripts for the browser and edit it instead of inline scripts
- [ ] which replaced tests should be restored and adjusted?
- [ ] Resolve `schedule-overlap-mobile-scroll:8` under chromium-mobile: read-only grid collapses to a single `data-row="0"` 15px row after the create-dialog flow; unit contract is `ScheduleOverlap.collapsedHours.test.ts` ("collapses the read-only specific-times band to the saved active subset") — decide spec fix vs product fix
- [ ] Stabilize `ensureSpecificTimesEditorMode` / `isSpecificTimesEnabled` E2E toggling in `firefox-touch` and `chromium-mobile`; remove force-click fallback only after reliable native interaction coverage
- [ ] Investigate intermittent `firefox-touch` mobile tooltip/navbar layering failure. Verify Responses tap isolation, outside dismissal, and visibility/`mouseleave` behavior on a real Firefox mobile device; Playwright touch emulation is insufficient
- [ ] In `frontend/e2e/sign-up-form-event.spec.ts`, capture a non-OK event POST's status and response body when it recurs, then compare its payload with `server/routes/events.go` timed-payload normalization
- [ ] Before production deployment, run and record the preflight status of `server/scripts/20260724_canonical_timed_events`; deploy the server before a frontend release that requires derived enabled-slot validation
- [ ] If unit tests become a CI bottleneck, profile with `npm run test:unit:profile`; retain default workers and `slowTestThreshold: 100` unless target-CI benchmarks justify a change. Convert suites away from `happy-dom` only when verified Node-safe
- [ ] after scrolling the grid, the circle inside the toggle is misaligned vertically, the No responses yet also changes the position
- [ ] Options should be higher than Responses?
- [ ] specify how the color at overlapping slots is calculated
- [ ] event Dates, edit event at the same height as best times, more options
- [ ] Create an event with specific times for dates May 30, 31, mark hours 0-4 for both dates, edit event, set dates for 28, 29, click next. See May 28, 30, 31 in specific times page, and May 30, 31 on the event page.
- [ ] Mark dates for only one day in specific times, save, edit again and see only one day on the event page
- [ ] Create an event for may 28 with availability from 0 to 4 and timezone +02:00. If you open the date picker in +0:00, should you see two days marked in the date picker?
- [ ] When adding availability, cancel and save should be aligned to the right
- [ ] Who are the group respondents?
- [ ] Make available/If needed on mobile higher to cover the "Adding availability" text
- [ ] Remove magic constants in CSS
- [ ] what is group (NewGroup.vue)?
- [ ] Handle narrow mobile screens (e.g. iPhone 17)
- [ ] "Editing availability as" shouldn't be in italic
- [ ] Collapse hours when editing response availability
- [ ] Mismatch between event page and specific times <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/Eb67A>
- [ ] When creating event with specific times and setting timezone, on the specific times page, the timezone should be set to the one specified in the event (during creation). For a user, shown in should be the same on the event page and specific times page
- [ ] Lost slots on the specific times page when selected all slots at +7, then switched to +6
- [ ] <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/EE2Fc> When editing event specific times, when "shown in" is +7, all slots for jun 15 are selected. When it's set to +6, jun 14 is duplicated and jun 15 is missing and there's a gap between jun 14 and jun 14.
- [ ] When I set specific times  0-4 on jun 14 and jun 16 when shown in is +5, then switch to +3,
      jun 15 doesn't appear although it should take some timeslots from jun 16
- [ ] what is the source of truth for enabled slots?
  - date picker may show dates that aren't shown when setting specific times.
    specific times editor should show these dates even if there are no enabled slots at these dates.
- [ ] Make a demo screenshot of <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/6df78>
- [ ] At <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/6df78>, when I hover over Maya Patel, I see if needed (yellow) for jun 20, 13:45-14:30 but it's available (green) when I edit her availability.

- [ ] should be able to edit specific times again
- [ ] not support recurring events to not bloat the localstorage with slots?
- [ ] When hover over collapsed stripe, don't show the pointer for selecting hours
- [ ] editing availability as - add input field to write the name over Available
- [ ] On the event page, in More options, "Show all hours" should be above "Hide if needed times"
- [ ] Everyone should be unavailable in responses when hover over red, light-grey, or dark-grey
- [ ] switch to when2meet in the repo
- [ ] make the app name configurable and when2meet by default
- [ ] why grey without grid in <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/Eb67A> at gmt+9?

- [ ] On mobile, when changing availability, don't show responses offcanvas panel
- [ ] Set up CI/CD (maybe CD on releases only)

## MUST

- [ ] Event can be edited only by the creator. The description too
- [ ] event in +3, edit specific times in +9, some time slots are lost
- [ ] event in +3,
- [ ] specific times uses the default 9-18 after unselecting 9-18
- [ ] when autofill is disabled, only manually should be enabled
- [ ] default hours for new event should be 9-18
- [ ] RIIR
  - [ ] switch to Postgres
  - [ ] use dbfirst
  - [ ] don't fix sign in functionality in the Go version
  - [ ] keep the original code in comments for line-by-line rewriting
- [ ] Remove split-gap
- [ ] given new days are added in edit event with specific times, when the specific times page is opened, then the new days should be available for editing
- [ ] there's no time when all 8 respondents are available should be over responses
- [ ] On a non-existing page, 404 must be centered vertically and horizontally
- [ ] Given I'm on the event page in read mode, when I click somewhere in the red zone, then the Add availability and/or Edit availability must blink
- [ ] On the event page, when a multi-line description is saved, then all lines should be displayed
- [ ] When the guest adds several responses, there should be a record for each response in localstorage
- [ ] when user clicks edit availability, they should see a drop-down list of all respondents whose availability they can change. own availabilities first, open for editing next, people with password last
- [ ] Enforce that the user name is always non-empty

      The core of this is a functional requirement:

      - which guest names are accepted or rejected
      - how respondent names are normalized
      - what data the API returns
      - how duplicates and legacy rows are handled

      It has some non-functional aspects:

      - data quality and consistency
      - robustness against malformed input
      - maintainability of one canonical contract
- [ ] On mobile, make tooltip durable - after scrolling the page, it should appear near the selected timeslot
  - Currently, when I click a grey slot, then scroll down, then return back, the tooltip disappears.
    When I click a grey slot, it reappears
- [ ] The event that spans two dates in the display time zone must appear on both dates
- [ ] Given I'm scheduling an event, when I'm outside of active cells, I can't schedule the event and when I'm inside them, I can schedule
- [ ] Collapsed hours should work in range events too, not only specific-times events
- [ ] On timed event page, Create an event and Give feedback should be bold like on dates-only page
- [ ] On dates-only event page, when I click the "Edit event" button, a form for editing the event opens
- [ ] Store only active timeslots and calculate all other types (enabled inactive and disabled) on the fly
- [ ] In glossary, define "guest", "anon"
- [ ] Password protection in responses for anon guests
- [ ] Make Crockford base32 encoding an ADR (less collisions)
- [ ] For date-specific events, make the dates not disappear
  - For <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/JTGTEFXY>, the dates disappeared several times,
    maybe because the agent run a container with another db volume

## SHOULD

- [ ] The grid lines should be black, not grey
- [ ] User settings for the time format
- [ ] In the new event form, in the date picker, show days of the previous month (not blank places) when showing the current month
- [ ] Cookie consent overlay
- [ ] When a user tries to sign in with an email, the system checks whether the email is already registered and the result is immediately displayed to the user
  - This creates a risk that some users may try brute-force emails and cause DoS
  - However, we're a small self-hosted app so we accept the risk
  - The UI may change in future to prevent such abuse, e.g. by rate-limiting the number of requests per second
- [ ] Add concurrency control
  - two users edit the event simultaneously
  - one user edits the event, another one edits the availability
- [ ] When `typescript-eslint` supports the installed TypeScript native bridge version in its peer dependency range, verify `npm ci --dry-run` succeeds without overrides and remove `--legacy-peer-deps` from `frontend/Dockerfile`.

## COULD

- [ ] anon identity to save preferences, maybe sign in by password
- [ ] use @dicebear/identicon for avatars, not generic head?
      The downside is that after updating the name, the avatar will change too.

- [x] In the new event form, in Advanced options, The Timezone text isn't aligned horizontally with "Time increment"
      The styling differs too
- [x] On the event page without responses, there should be only Add availability and Show all hours, not very wide Add availability and More options

      "Show all hours" should be under "Add availability", as before.
      The toggle and "Show all hours" text should be centered vertically within their box
- [x] Create event with 9 - 17, timezone +9 (<http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/ee4Cb>), june 11 and 12.
      Expected: june 10 and 11 are shown on the event page
      Actual: june 11, 12, 13 are shown there
- [x] Spacing between lines is different when editing and viewing event description
- [x] Shown in shouldn't affect the time zone
- [x] Availability not rendered at <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/Eb67A>

- [x] get rid of 12-hour format?
   No
- [x] remove Add availability, leave just edit availability
   No. In this case, we won't be able to add availability for someone
- [x] don't uncollapse rows when scheduling
- [x] show event when rescheduling
- [x] Schedule button on mobile should be filled blueish when clicked
- [x] When there's a scheduled event and I edit availability, I shold draw only with green cells, not blue cells (scheduled)
- [x] when editing availability, overlay availabilities should preserve the marked time slots and not shift
- [x] set specific times - just select, don't draw scheduled event
- [x] on mobile, edit availability is permanently greenish although should be like that only after a click
  - It's ok - it's disabled
- [x] on mobile and desktop, there should be no delay between selecting the time slot and seeing the tooltip with time and date
- [x] on mobile, I shouldn't be able to click the grid through that Responses offcanvas
- [x] on mobile, the tooltip should stay near selected timeslot and shouldn't move around
  - now we store the info about the selected timeslot and render based on its position
- [x] in commit skill, make the script for session identifier and time a single script
- [x] on mobile, when scrolling, the tooltip with time should scroll together with selected cell, not stay frozen at the same height of the screen while the screen scrolls
- [x] on mobile, when no slot is selected, the tooltip shouldn't be visible
- [x] When a timeslot is selected, it's position is saved.
      When the page is reloaded, the selection is rendered at the timeslot.
      However, there's no tooltip near the selection.
- [x] on mobile, when long press inside the grid changes the selected timeslot, the tooltip must also appear near the selected timeslot
  - currently, it stays near the previously selected timeslot
- [x] on mobile, when long press inside the grid makes the timeslot selected, the tooltip must appear near it.
  - currently, the tooltip doesn't appear
- [x] on mobile, the tooltip should be under top navbar when the grid gets scrolled up
- [x] On the event page without responses, there should be only Add availability and Show all hours, not very wide Add availability and More options

      "Show all hours" should be under "Add availability", as before.
      The toggle and "Show all hours" text should be centered vertically within their box

- [x] "Best times" toggle should appear when there is at least one response, not more than one
- [x] When Best times and More options are both visible, they should be side by side
- [x] On mobile, on the event page, when swiping inside the grid, the grid should scroll just like when swiping outside
- [x] "select in Add/Edit availability" -> "change in ..."
- [x] On mobile, on the event page, when not interacting with the grid, make it scrollable with finger on the grid
- [x] Disabled padding cells - "Unavailable, outside the event dates in the event timezone"
- [x] In desktop app, in firefox, the selected timeslot must follow the mouse when it moves inside the grid, no matter clicks.
- [x] doesn't show time on hover after clicking and moving the cursor - <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/dEeaF>
  - Can't reproduce
- [x] on mobile, tooltip should be below the Responses offcanvas panel
- [x] get rid of the comparator, leave just inspect and update docs
- [x] Given I'm on the event page, when I move the mouse cursor out of the grid, the Responses must show just the number of responses and not show who's available
- [x] In the desktop version, the alignment of rows in add/edit availability should be similar to the event page.

      - event title - Cancel, Save
      - Edit event - Show all hours
      - Add description - shouldn't be visible, actually
- [x] make scheduled event color #76AFF2 so that it's visible on the green background
- [x] Given on the event page, when scrolled down, then clicked Edit event, then the navbar (timeful, create an event, etc.) must not move higher
- [x] On the event page, align:
      - event title with Add availability/Edit availability
      - "Edit event" and Copy link with Show best times and More options
      - The event description with Schedule/Reschedule event
- [x] When changing availability, there should be these buttons:
  
  - Cancel | Save
  - Overlay availability | More options (Show all hours)
  - Delete
- [x] show all hours should show all hours, not trimmed. Currently, it trims wrong
  - can't reproduce
- [x] Given on the edit availability page, when no timeslot is marked as available/if needed, then the Save button should be disabled
- [x] Allow multiple scheduled events.

    Remove clear in Reschedule event because one can just wipe it by dragging the event cursor.

    Should behave just like the availability cursor.

    Given I clicked Reschedule event,
    when I click a slot that belongs to the existing event, the slot gets cleared
    and when I click a free slot, it becomes an event slot
    and adjacent slots merge into a single event

  - Won't implement because it makes the interface much more complicated.
    If there's 0 slots selected, how to save?
    If there's several events selected, need to warn that exactly one event is required to schedule on Google Calendar
- [x] On desktop, the width of buttons when adding availability should be the same as on the event page
- [x] On desktop, when rescheduling event, add availability, edit availability, edit event should be disabled
- [x] On desktop, Shown in and timezone should be above Responses and scroll with it so that when all timeslots are shown
     and one selects a timeslot and see the tooltip with the time, they can see which timezone that time belongs to
- [x] Use monospace font for times
  - [x] in the grid
  - [x] in the tooltip
- [x] Don't show the cursor and tooltip in enabled, inactive or disabled cells
- [x] On mobile, given I'm on the event page and a timeslot is selected and the tooltip is visible, when I click the responses offcanvas, the selected timeslot and its tooltip must not disappear
- [x] On mobile, make the grid labels fit on the screen
- [x] Given I'm on desktop and on the event page, when I hover over collapsed hours,
  - the responses should show 0/N (behave similarly to disabled cells)
  - and mark everyone unavailable
  - and the selection at the highlight at the last hovered timeslot must be cleared
- [x] Given the selected dates are non-consecutive and make the grid split into sub-grids (e.g. Aug 6 and 9), when I click (desktop, mobile) or hover (desktop) in the space between sub-grids, the highlight and tooltip at the last selected timeslot must be cleared like when clicking or hovering inactive timeslots
- [x] On desktop, given I'm on the event page, when I hover an active timeslot or hover outside the grid and then hover over an inactive slot, then the Responses sidebar should show (0/N) and all responses crossed-out and the status square should have the corresponding color (light-grey for enabled, inactive etc.)
- [x] On mobile, buttons with arrows for switching pages when there are several days, buttons should be the same size
- [x] On mobile, when I click a disabled timeslot, the selection should disappear
- [x] On desktop, given I'm on the event page, when I hover or click inside the grid outside active cells, the highlight at the last timeslot and any tooltip should not be visible
- [x] Create a glossary and oblige agents to read it in AGENTS.md
- [x] In responses,
  - when I hover or click in a grid, show the square for the status of a person at the corresponding timeslot (available, if needed, unavailable, etc.) instead of a profile image;
  - when I hover or click outside of the grid, replace the status square with a profile icon like it's now
- [x] Add "Disabled, collapsed" legend item
- [x] dashed outline in the legend bullet for Disabled, collapsed
- [x] In the new event form, the event time format should be persisted in the localstorage
- [x] The event time format should have a separate state from the display time format on the event page
- [x] The display time format doesn't inherit from the event time format
  - The display format is a personal setting. It's stored globally. When the user sets the format for one event, all other events use the same format.
- [x] On desktop, in the new event form and on the new event page, when I scroll the time zone menu, the width is always 520 and doesn't change based on the content length.
- [x] Schedule event on Google Calendar should happen in the display timezone
- [x] Given I'm on the event page and there's a scheduled event, when I click Reschedule event, the Schedule button is active
- [x] On the Event not found page, when using tab-navigation, the rectangle should coincide with the Back to home button
- [x] On desktop, on a dates only event page, in the second row, on the right:
  - When there are no responses, show "Start on Monday" option in the second row
  - When there are responses, show "Show best days" option and "More options" (which includes "Start on Monday" and "Hide if needed")
- [x] For dates-only events, the combination of days of week and dates in the calendar must match the reality
- [x] For dates-only events, the color of disabled dates must be dark-grey like for disabled padding cells in timed event
- [x] On the Event not found page, the "Back to home" button must have a black shadow (like on the home page), not greenish glow
- [x] Add format 12h/24h - in the event creation form
- [x] Make the format in the event form independent of the local format on the event page
- [x] "If needed" - show in the legend to explain the status color in responses
- [x] On dates-only event page, the Responses top of the text must horizontally coincide with the top edge of the grid
- [x] Keep yellow status for "if needed" responses but don't:
  - highlight such responses text
  - show asterisk ("\*") near such responses
  - show "* if needed" under responses
- [x] On the read-only timed event page, when I switch the timezone, the grid shouldn't collapse
- [x] In timed range events, the Legend shall show the light-gray "Disabled, change in Edit event"
- [x] Address linter warnings
- [x] In "New event" form, when "Dates only" is selected, in "Advanced options", there should be no "Time increment"
- [x] On the dates-only event page, when I click the "Edit event" button, then the edit form opens
- [x] On dates-only event page, there must be space between the grid and Responses sidebar

- [x] On the dates-only event page, "Start on Monday" must be centered vertically with "Add availability"
- [x] When VITE_ENABLE_SIGN_IN is not false, on the landing page, there should be the Sign in button.
      When I click that button, "Sign in" page opens with options like Google Calendar / Email.
- [x] On each page, Sign in must be the left-most button
- [x] For date-specific events, when I edit the timezone in the form, it shall be persisted.
  - Currently, it's always set to GMT+0:00
- [x] Given I sign in, when I enter an unregistered email and click Continue with email:
  - The input field is highlighted red
  - The error appears like on accounts.google.com: (red alert icon) "Couldn’t find this account. Create account"
- [x] Consistently use "Sign in" and "Sign up" in the sign in flow.
- [x] Don't provide support text in the Sign up form because such text is redundant.
- [x] Use TypeScript 7 to speed up compilation
- [x] Use oxlint to speed up linting
- [x] Update references from deemp/timeful to whensync/timeful
  - Reserved whensync just in case I'd like to rename the project in future
- [x] Fix event description card
  - Multi-line event descriptions save with newline characters preserved.
  - Saved multi-line descriptions render across multiple lines.
  - Read-only description pencil is in the upper-right corner.
  - Edit mode preserves the description’s text width and wrapping.
  - Edit mode cancel and save buttons are in the upper-right corner.
  - Description action buttons are reduced to 32px and visually centered for single-line descriptions.
- [x] Hovering a disabled date on a dates-only event now gives respondents a disabled status, not active/unavailable.
- [x] The dates-only legend now shows Unavailable, change in Add/Edit availability, matching timed events.
- [x] Fix highlighting in dates-only events
  - Enabled dates-only grid cells receive a black inset square frame on hover.
  - The frame stays inside the cell and does not overlap neighboring cells or the date number.
  - The date text does not change from border-box layout shifts.
  - Hovering a disabled cell removes the prior enabled-cell frame.
  - Hovering a disabled cell shows disabled status in Responses.
  - Leaving the grid removes the current frame.
  - On mobile, tapping a disabled cell removes the current frame while showing disabled Responses status.
  - On mobile, tapping outside the grid removes the current frame and clears its state.
- [x] Fix gap on the right for dates-only events.
  - Dates-only grid fits within narrow viewports from 320px through 639px.
  - Grid has a 16px left and right gutter on phone layouts.
  - No horizontal document overflow at 320, 390, 410, 480, 639, and 640px.
  - Below 640px, the sidebar remains stacked beneath the calendar and fits the viewport.
  - At 640px, grid and sidebar remain side-by-side with their intended 16–20px gap.
  - The full-width dates-only grid no longer adds external margin beyond its pane.
- [x] On the dates-only event page, the date cells must be rectangular 1:2 (height:width) to better fit the screen
- [x] When editing an event, switching between Dates and times and Dates only must be disabled
- [x] On dates-only page, show read-only timezone above Responses.
  - Dates-only event page shows the planned event timezone above Responses.
  - It is display-only, not a button or selector.
  - It uses the persisted timezone set in Edit event.
  - Editing and saving the timezone updates the displayed value immediately.
  - Timed events do not show this additional Responses timezone label.
  - Layout regression coverage confirms the label is positioned above Responses and aligned with the dates-only grid.
- [x] Improve separation between environments (development, test, staging, production)
- [x] Don't run vite in a container to keep things simple and fast during development
- [x] <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/aB3BE>
  - ok in gmt+3
  - padding gets added in +3:30 although not needed
  - grid split in +12 although shouldn't
  
  Status: can't reproduce

- [x] rename PR (<https://github.com/schej-it/timeful.app/pull/250>) to `Modernize the app`
- [x] Use Node 26.5.0 everywhere
- [x] On the specific times page <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/Eb67A>, when I switch timezone from +5 to +6, the left-most upper-most enabled slot should become disabled
- [x] On the specific times page <http://127.0.0.1:4173/e/Eb67A>, when I switch timezone from +5 to +4 and on june 14, 0-4 are selected, jun 13 should appear
