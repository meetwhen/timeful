# E2E Authoring and Debugging

Rules for Playwright specs, helpers, and repro entrypoints under `./e2e`.

## Failure Diagnosis Loop

- Run a failing test in isolation before changing anything: `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium-desktop -g "<test title>"`.
- Read the full error output first; Playwright prints the action call log with the waiting locator, the resolved element, and the retry attempts.
- Open the failure trace with `npx playwright show-trace tmp/playwright/<spec-dir>/trace.zip`; config retains traces for every failed test, including local runs with zero retries.
- Diagnose why the element was missing, hidden, ambiguous, or non-actionable; do not fix a timeout by adding a fixed sleep or by raising timeouts blindly.
- Re-run the isolated test after each fix; widen back to the full project only once it passes.
- Use `npm run test:e2e -- --ui` for interactive step-by-step debugging and `DEBUG=pw:api` for protocol-level verbose logging.

## Authoring Rules

- Use user-facing locators: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, and `getByTestId`; add a `data-testid` in app code when no accessible role exists.
- ESLint forbids `page.$`, `page.$$`, `page.pause`, `page.waitForSelector`, and raw `page.waitForTimeout` under `./e2e`.
- Assert with web-first expectations such as `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `toHaveCount()`, and `toContainText()`; they auto-retry, so never hand-roll polling.
- Use `expect(locator).toHaveCount()` when ambiguity is possible; strict mode fails loudly on multiple matches instead of acting on the wrong element.
- Pass an explicit timeout only with a reason; the default action timeout is 15 seconds and the default expect timeout is 5 seconds.
- Keep one behavior per test, and wrap long journeys in `test.step()` so traces and errors name the failing step.
- Seed state through the API instead of long UI setup journeys; reuse `./helpers` builders such as `seedCanonicalTimedEvent`.
- Treat fixed settle delays as exceptions; use `settlePage` from `./helpers/settle` only when no state-based wait can express the condition, for example settling a CSS transition after resize.

## Environment

- `npm run test:e2e` owns the isolated test stack (`mongo-test`, `postgres-test`, `server-test` on 3003) and Vite on 4174; never target the development API on 3002.
- See `../AGENTS.md` for required checks and `./inspect/AGENTS.md` for `npm run inspect` diagnostics.
