# Functional Requirements

## FR-001

A guest can add availability several times. Store all records in the guest browser.

## FR-002

Each column in the grid must contain only the dates that belong to the same date.

## FR-003

Responses can only be edited, not deleted.

## FR-004

If the response can be edited, there's a pencil on the right. Otherwise, a lock.

## FR-005

Button styles on the event page follow Material Design:

- `Add availability`: filled primary, subtle shadow if needed for separation, no persistent glow
- `Edit availability`: filled primary, calmer than add, no glow
- `Edit event` and `Copy link`: outlined, no shadow

## FR-006

Setting "Shown in" shouldn't affect the initial event time zone.

## FR-007

When scheduling an event, it can't be empty.

## FR-008

Availability can't be empty.

## FR-009

In the new event form, when I click a button near the month or the year, the form should stay in place and not scroll to the top.

## FR-010

In the new event form, when the event name isn't set and when the user changes the month, the form scrolls to the top adn requires the event name to remind the user to set it.

## FR-011

On the response edit page, overlay availabilities shall show all availabilities, without hiding.

## FR-012

When there are responses but no responses to edit, the user should see disabled Edit availability button.

## FR-013

`available` and `if needed` shall not overlap.

## FR-014

Dates picked in the date picker shall be the source of truth for enabled time slots.

## FR-015

When sign in is disabled, all related functionality on the frontend must be gated.

## FR-016

When scheduling an event, the tooltip with the info about the time slot should follow the mouse cursor and not be above the slot where scheduling the event started

## FR-017

Default hours for a new event should be 9-18.

## FR-018

Grid colors shall use context-specific labels:

- In the specific-times editor: white is `Selected for the event`, light grey is `Selectable for the event`, and dark grey is `Disabled, outside the event dates in the event timezone`.
- In every event availability grid, pale red is `Unavailable, change in Add/Edit availability` for an active slot that is unavailable to the current respondent.
- In a saved specific-times event grid, light grey is `Disabled, change in Edit event` for an enabled but inactive slot. Range-event grids shall not show this legend item.
- In every event availability grid, dark grey is `Disabled, outside the event dates in the event timezone`. For range events it is the only grey legend item.
- The event availability legend shall show only items that can occur in the current mode. It shall not expose internal terms such as enabled, inactive, or outside the selected range.
- Specific-times enabled inactive cells shall remain editable, while dark-grey padding cells outside the enabled domain shall be non-editable.
- Padding shall appear only in cells without an enabled slot for that display-date column. It shall not be created by page-wide filler rows; range grids may include only the non-enabled cells necessary to reach their hour-aligned axis boundaries.

## FR-019

Collapsed hours rectangle height should be the same as half-hour line.

## FR-020

Each full-hour line in the grid should have a label on the left, including top of the collapsed hours rectangle.

## FR-021

Specific-times events shall preserve a separate enabled-slot domain and active-slot selection:

- The enabled domain shall be the full civil day (`00:00` through the next `00:00` exclusive, in the event timezone) of every picked date, whether or not specific times were entered at creation.
- Specific-times grid columns shall be the ordered union of picked dates and enabled-slot dates projected into the displayed timezone.
- A slot that projects across midnight shall appear in its display-local date column; the grid shall add that adjacent column when needed.
- Picked-date columns shall remain visible even when they contain no projected enabled slots.
- Saving shall drop any active instant outside the enabled full-day domain.

## FR-022

Time-range picker labels shall represent the end-of-day boundary clearly:

- In 24-hour mode, labels shall be zero-padded from `00:00` through `23:00`, followed by `24:00`.
- In 12-hour mode, the end-of-day option shall be `12 AM`.
- Selecting the end-of-day boundary shall render as `00:00` in the next date column of the grid.

## FR-023

When `Show all hours` is disabled, the grid shall collapse inactive runs based on active-slot membership:

- Leading, interior, and trailing inactive runs shall be eligible for collapse.
- Collapse bands shall align to complete hours and require at least three consecutive inactive hours.
- The left time axis shall show each collapsed band's start boundary and day-boundary labels such as `00:00`.
- Wrapped overnight ranges shall use a continuous time axis without a structural split gap.
- A range that projects across midnight shall continue at `00:00` in its adjacent display-date column. The grid shall not add synthetic day-offset labels such as `+1 00:00`.
- Schedule drags shall end only on active slots; moving into an enabled inactive slot shall retain the last active endpoint.
- Calendar, selected, and saved scheduled-event overlays shall render as contiguous visible fragments and shall not cross collapsed rows.

## FR-024

Anyone with the event link can schedule a selected time range on Timeful:

- The Schedule menu shall list `Timeful` first, with a Timeful icon, followed by Google Calendar and Outlook.
- The mobile Schedule action shall offer the same three destinations.
- Selecting Timeful shall persist the selected range and render it as an unlabelled, solid, shadowed `#76AFF2` indicator centered at 70% of its day-column width, so availability remains visible behind it.
- Anyone with the event link can schedule, reschedule, or clear the Timeful schedule.
- After saving a Timeful schedule, viewers shall see `Reschedule event` and `Clear` actions.
- Starting rescheduling shall hide the saved block; saving a new Timeful range shall replace the prior schedule.
- The legend shall permanently include a `#76AFF2` `Scheduled event` item matching the scheduled-event indicator.

## FR-025

Canonical timed-event grids shall preserve slot instants when the display timezone changes:

- Changing `Shown in` shall not change an enabled or active slot's instant.
- A slot's displayed clock label and tooltip shall use the selected display timezone.
- A slot shall render at most once in a grid and shall not be duplicated because its displayed time crosses midnight.
- Wrapped ranges shall remain continuous without structural split gaps.

## FR-026

Timed grids shall distinguish the enabled-slot domain from the active-slot selection according to the editing mode.

- A timed-grid column represents a slot's projected date in the selected `Shown in` timezone. Changing `Shown in` may add, remove, or reassign projected date columns while preserving every slot instant.
- `Shown in` changes a slot's displayed date, clock time, tooltip date/time, and grid column. A slot projected across midnight shall render at its normal clock time in its adjacent projected-date column; the grid shall create that column when needed and shall not render a synthetic next-day axis row.
- While setting specific times, every increment from `00:00` inclusive through the next `00:00` exclusive shall be an enabled slot for every picked date. The editor grid shall show that full-day domain. Selected slots are active; enabled inactive slots remain editable; cells outside the enabled domain are non-editable padding.
- On the event page for a specific-times event, the grid shall collapse its axis to the saved active-range band (active slots, falling back to the enabled domain), with inactive spans eligible for the existing collapsed-hours behavior. The full civil-day axis shall appear only in the specific-times editor or when `Show all hours` is enabled. Active slots are respondent-selectable. Enabled inactive slots are not respondent-selectable and shall not be presented as padding.
- On the event page for a range event, only increments in the selected range are active. The grid shall render the selected range with hour-aligned axis boundaries; it need not render the rest of the day. Any non-enabled cell rendered by those boundaries is dark-grey `Disabled, outside the event dates in the event timezone`.
- The legend shall use the context-specific labels in FR-018. It shall not expose internal enabled/active-domain terminology.

## FR-027

Timed grids shall preserve every enabled slot on daylight-saving-time transition days.

- A grid cell's identity shall be its instant, not its displayed clock label.
- When clocks move backward and a local clock time occurs twice, the grid shall render both slots in chronological order and distinguish their labels with the applicable timezone offset or abbreviation.
- When clocks move forward and local clock times do not exist, the grid shall not render nonexistent slots.
- The same instant-preserving behavior applies to enabled-slot membership, active-slot selection, availability responses, drag selection, scheduling, and tooltips.
