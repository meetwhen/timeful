# PostgreSQL Anonymous Event Compatibility Contract

## Scope

These tables own only new anonymous timed and dates-only polls.
MongoDB remains
authoritative for legacy events, authenticated creation, groups, signup forms,
folders, account adoption, and dashboard event loading. `postgres_events` and
`postgres_event_responses` are not HTTP DTOs and must not use BSON types.

`postgres_events.id` and `postgres_event_responses.id` are internal UUIDv7
identities.
API handlers expose only `short_id`, an eight-character Crockford
Base32 identifier.
PostgreSQL's UUID primary key remains internal.

## Explicit Columns

Event columns hold identifiers, soft-delete state, name, type, response count,
schedule version, creator PostHog ID, and timestamps.
Response columns hold the
event relation, an Event Visitor Identity owner, opaque response-map lookup
identity, and timestamps.
PostgreSQL Platform Identities and Event Visitor
Identities use internal UUID relations; Mongo user IDs remain external strings,
with no cross-database foreign key.

`canonical_guest_name` is produced by `respondents.NormalizeGuestName` in Go.
PostgreSQL must not reimplement guest-name normalization.
PostgreSQL permits
multiple responses per Event Visitor Identity.
Each response's event relation
and its owner Event Visitor Identity must identify the same event through a
composite database constraint or equivalent enforced invariant.

## JSONB Payloads

`postgres_events.payload` holds all remaining event state, including:

- Description and nullable/default settings.
- Dates, active slots, timezone, slot generation, and timed recurrence.
- Legacy schedule fields retained for compatibility.
- Selected-schedule snapshot, remindees, attendee-compatible fields, and
  unsupported-feature fields accepted by existing request decoding.

`postgres_event_responses.payload` holds display name, email, availability,
if-needed availability, manual availability, and calendar-related fields.

JSON arrays preserve their existing behavior: date and recurrence arrays keep
input order and duplicates; active slots are normalized by route validation;
response availability keeps first-seen order after deduplication.
Instants are
normalized to millisecond precision before writing JSONB and before API output.

## Compatibility Rules

The repository must distinguish absent fields, JSON null, empty arrays/maps,
and zero scalar values.
In particular, an omitted description preserves the
existing value, an explicit empty description persists, and a timed edit with
an explicit empty `activeSlots` retains the existing slots to match Mongo BSON
`omitempty` behavior.
Public schedule save/replace/clear remains supported.

For PostgreSQL, an Event Visitor Control Credential (EVCC) authorizes
management of every response owned by its Event Visitor Identity in that event.
The public `eventVisitorId` is an identifier, not proof.
A Granted EVCC is a
distinct, source-revocable delegated credential; neither credential value is
exposed to application JavaScript.
Legacy MongoDB guest-edit-token behavior is
unchanged and is not a PostgreSQL compatibility constraint.

PostgreSQL response maps use opaque response IDs.
The API must define explicit
creation, selected-response, update, and deletion contracts that remain valid
when one Event Visitor Identity owns multiple responses.
Blind-availability
payloads must expose a non-owner only responses the non-owner is authorized to
manage and must not leak other-response counts.

## Transactions

Response create, update, and delete lock the event row and update the response
row plus `num_responses` in one transaction.
Guest rename, policy changes, and
legacy-to-token transitions are also transactional.
Unique-index conflicts
must map to the existing duplicate-name route error.
Event edit and selected
schedule replace/clear write the event aggregate atomically.

Transactions deliberately prevent duplicate response races and response-count
drift; reproducing those internal Mongo failure modes is not required for API
compatibility.
