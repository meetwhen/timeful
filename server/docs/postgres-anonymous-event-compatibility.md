# PostgreSQL Anonymous Event Compatibility Contract

## Scope

These tables own new supported events for anonymous and signed-in creation: [Timed Event](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#timed-event), [Dates-Only Event](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#dates-only-event), day-of-week, availability group, and signup form kinds.
PostgreSQL is the only store for every record kind; calendar connections, provider tokens, OTP challenges, historical daily user logs, and the retired friend requests are owned by the [PostgreSQL Retained-Data Migration Contracts](postgres-retained-data-contracts.md).
`postgres_events` and `postgres_event_responses` are not HTTP DTOs.
The compatibility rules below continue to govern the observable API behavior of PostgreSQL-owned records.

`postgres_events.id` and `postgres_event_responses.id` are internal UUIDv7 identities.
API handlers expose only `short_id`, an eight-character Crockford Base32 identifier.
PostgreSQL's UUID primary key remains internal.

## Explicit Columns

Event columns hold identifiers, soft-delete state, name, type, response count, schedule version, creator PostHog ID, and timestamps.
Response columns hold the event relation, an Event Visitor Identity owner, opaque response-map lookup identity, and timestamps.
PostgreSQL Platform Identities and Event Visitor Identities use internal UUID relations; migrated external account IDs remain plain strings with no cross-database foreign key.

`canonical_guest_name` is produced by `respondents.NormalizeGuestName` in Go.
PostgreSQL must not reimplement guest-name normalization.
PostgreSQL permits multiple responses per Event Visitor Identity.
Each response's event relation and its owner Event Visitor Identity must identify the same event through a composite database constraint or equivalent enforced invariant.

## JSONB Payloads

`postgres_events.payload` holds all remaining event state, including:

- Description and nullable/default settings.
- Dates, active slots, timezone, slot generation, and timed recurrence.
- Legacy schedule fields retained for compatibility.
- Selected-schedule snapshot, remindees, attendee-compatible fields, and
  unsupported-feature fields accepted by existing request decoding.

`postgres_event_responses.payload` holds display name, email, availability, if-needed availability, manual availability, and calendar-related fields.

JSON arrays preserve their existing behavior: date and recurrence arrays keep input order and duplicates; active slots are normalized by route validation; response availability keeps first-seen order after deduplication.
Instants are normalized to millisecond precision before writing JSONB and before API output.

## Compatibility Rules

The repository must distinguish absent fields, JSON null, empty arrays/maps, and zero scalar values.
In particular, an omitted description preserves the existing value, an explicit empty description persists, and a timed edit with an explicit empty `activeSlots` retains the existing slots to match the legacy field-omission behavior.
Public schedule save/replace/clear remains supported while the event is not archived.

For PostgreSQL, an Event Visitor Control Credential (EVCC) authorizes management of every response owned by its Event Visitor Identity in that event.
The public `eventVisitorId` is an identifier, not proof.
A Granted EVCC is a distinct, source-revocable delegated credential; neither credential value is exposed to application JavaScript.
Legacy guest-edit-token behavior is not a PostgreSQL compatibility constraint.

PostgreSQL response maps use opaque response IDs.
The API must define explicit creation, selected-response, update, and deletion contracts that remain valid when one Event Visitor Identity owns multiple responses.
Blind-availability payloads must expose a non-owner only responses the non-owner is authorized to manage and must not leak other-response counts.

## Delivered Identity Foundation

PostgreSQL event creation establishes an event-scoped Event Visitor Identity and returns its public `eventVisitorId` with the created event.
Creation also issues the private EVCC as an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie scoped to `/api`; the credential value never reaches application JavaScript.
The browser retains `eventVisitorId` per event in localStorage so the identity survives reloads and sign-out, while authority always comes from the EVCC cookie or an authenticated Platform Identity session.

Signing in associates known browser Event Visitor Identities with the private Platform Identity through `POST /auth/visitor-identities`.
Association never grants authority by itself; response authorization still requires the source EVCC or the associated Platform Identity session.

PostgreSQL response maps are keyed by the opaque `publicId`, and each entry carries `canEdit` so the client can offer exactly the edits the server will honor.
Response mutation uses an explicit-selection contract: `createResponse: true` creates a new response for the calling Event Visitor Identity, and every edit, deletion, and rename must carry the target `responseId`; otherwise the route rejects with `select-response-or-explicitly-create`.
The browser plugin `set-slots` wire contract is unchanged; the frontend maps the plugin's named response onto the explicit-selection contract (existing named response, else selected response, else create) before calling the API, and the respondents-list delete submits the same `responseId` contract.

Event creation records the creator's [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity) separately from the event's ownership association.
A blind-availability read exposes all responses only with [Event Owner](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner) authority; other visitors see only responses they are authorized to manage, with other-response counts omitted.

The migration downgrade is intentionally refused because the legacy schema cannot represent multiple responses per Event Visitor Identity.

## Delivered Event Owner Authority

PostgreSQL creation issues a distinct [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token) in an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie scoped to `/api`, with Secure enabled for HTTPS requests.
Only its SHA-256 hash is stored; the credential value never reaches application JavaScript.
The token authorizes [Event Settings](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-settings) edits, archive/unarchive, and deletion, but does not authorize [Event Response](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-response) edits.
Base [Event Visitor Control Credentials (EVCCs)](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-control-credential-evcc) never authorize these owner actions, including the creator's credential.

Ownership has its own [Platform Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#platform-visitor-identity) association, separate from the creator's [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity) and [Event Responses](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-response).
An associated account can manage the event without the original cookie.
Proving the [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token) while signed in associates ownership with that account, replacing any previous ownership association without transferring response ownership.
Ownership takeover and protected mutations serialize under the event row lock.

Event reads expose server-proven `canEditSettings` and `canManageEvent` capabilities for frontend controls.
Archived events remain readable and allow authorized unarchive or deletion, but reject settings, response, rename, and selected-schedule mutations.
Deleted events and their responses stop resolving through event routes.

The credential schema and validator distinguish an owner-issued [Granted Event Visitor Control Credential (Granted EVCC)](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#granted-event-visitor-control-credential-granted-evcc) through explicit credential-kind and owner-grant metadata, and reject revoked grants.
Repository fixtures and source-confirmed transfer regressions verify this authority.

The migration preserves ownership already associated through the creator's [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity).
Older anonymous events have no recoverable [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token); without an existing ownership association, their settings, archive state, and deletion cannot be managed after this migration.
Existing base credentials are deliberately not promoted to owner authority.

## Transactions

Response create, update, and delete lock the event row and update the response row plus `num_responses` in one transaction.
Guest rename, policy changes, and legacy-to-token transitions are also transactional.
Unique-index conflicts must map to the existing duplicate-name route error.
Event edit and selected schedule replace/clear write the event aggregate atomically.

Transactions deliberately prevent duplicate response races and response-count drift.

## Source-Confirmed Access Transfers

On a PostgreSQL event page, choose `Continue on another device`, then `Create transfer link`.
Open the copied link in the other browser and enter its matching code on the source browser.
Choose `Approve matching code` on the source, then `Continue after approval` on the target, within five minutes of creating the link.
Opening the link alone grants no access, and each browser opening it receives an independent code.
The source can cancel a pending or approved-but-unredeemed link or create a new link after expiry.

A signed-in source creates a normal session for the same [Platform Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#platform-visitor-identity) on the target.
Redemption replaces only the target session's identity and preserves its unrelated session keys.
An anonymous source must prove its [Event Visitor Control Credential (EVCC)](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-control-credential-evcc); an anonymous [Event Owner](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner) must also prove the [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token).
The target receives a distinct [Granted Event Visitor Control Credential (Granted EVCC)](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#granted-event-visitor-control-credential-granted-evcc), preserving the source role and ownership while retaining the target's own [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity).
Owner grants permit settings edits, visibility of all responses, archive/unarchive, and deletion.
Ordinary grants permit only the source's response authority, including the same privacy restrictions in [Blind Availability Mode](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#blind-availability-mode).

The source dialog retains revocation handles across reloads and offers `Revoke access` for issued anonymous grants.
Grants have no fixed server-side expiry; clearing target browser data or source revocation removes that browser's delegated authority.
Expired pending, approved, and cancelled transfers are pruned automatically together with their requests, while redeemed transfers are retained as revocation anchors.
Normal signed-in sessions use the ordinary session lifecycle and do not offer grant revocation.
When the target signs in, the app asks before associating the source [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity) with its [Platform Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#platform-visitor-identity), including sign-in from outside the event page.
`Not now` leaves the grant usable without associating the source; `Confirm association` enables durable response recovery without associating event ownership.
Explicitly accepted account recovery is independent of later grant revocation.

All paths below are relative to `/api` and resolve PostgreSQL events only.

| `POST /events/{eventId}/transfers/{transferId}/status`  | Source proof returns `state`, `requests`, and `revocable`; target requests cannot inspect source status.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `POST /events/{eventId}/transfers/{transferId}/approve` | Source proof plus exact `{requestId, code}` selects one target and consumes the pending state.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `POST /events/{eventId}/grant-association`              | `{confirm: false}` inspects consent requirements; only explicit `{confirm: true}` with an active grant and authenticated session associates the source response identity.                                                                                      |

Source proofs, target proofs, and anonymous grants use separate HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies scoped to `/api`, with Secure enabled over HTTPS.
Raw source credentials and owner tokens are never copied to the target or exposed to JavaScript.
Lifecycle mutations serialize under event and transfer row locks, preserving single redemption under concurrent requests.
Session encoding occurs before committing redemption, and failed transactions discard session cookie headers.
Expired, cancelled, mismatched, unapproved, reused, cross-event, unauthorized, and revoked credentials or transfers are rejected.
