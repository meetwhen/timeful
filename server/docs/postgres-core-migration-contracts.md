# PostgreSQL Core Migration Contracts

## Scope

This document is the backend contract for moving core account, event, response, attendee, signup, group, and folder data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.
It defines the authoritative-store boundary, the field ownership inventory, legacy identity resolution, authority-quarantine rules, and the staged backfill and cutover contract.
It constrains TASK-0190.02 through TASK-0190.08 and complements [PostgreSQL Anonymous Event Compatibility Contract](postgres-anonymous-event-compatibility.md).
Table and column names introduced here are contractual targets for later subtasks; this task adds no runtime code, schema, or migration tooling.

MongoDB was fully retired on 2026-09-11 by TASK-0199.09; PostgreSQL is the only store and no repository path reads or writes MongoDB.
The migration and cutover statements below describe the executed core migration and are retained as contract history; the [PostgreSQL Core Migration Runbook](postgres-core-migration-runbook.md) records the executed evidence and the final collection retirement.

## Relationship To Existing Contracts

[PostgreSQL Anonymous Event Compatibility Contract](postgres-anonymous-event-compatibility.md) remains authoritative for the behavior of new anonymous PostgreSQL events.
Its statements that "MongoDB remains authoritative for legacy events, authenticated creation, groups, signup forms, folders, account adoption, and dashboard event loading" describe the repository before core cutover and stop applying to each migrated record once that record is served from PostgreSQL.
Where this document and the compatibility contract disagree about a PostgreSQL-owned record, this document governs the migration boundary and the compatibility contract continues to govern observable API behavior.

[PostgreSQL Retained-Data Migration Contracts](postgres-retained-data-contracts.md) supersedes this document's treatment of calendar integration fields, OTP challenges, historical daily user logs, friend requests, and reporting analytics.
The statements here that those fields stay in MongoDB describe the state before the retained-data cutover and stop applying to each record kind once that contract migrates it.
The retained-data contract governs their PostgreSQL destinations, the encrypted credential boundary, the retained-data backfill, and the removal of MongoDB.

The [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token) rules in the compatibility contract continue to apply.
Legacy MongoDB owner authorization was preserved on MongoDB-served records and was never promoted into PostgreSQL authority.

## Authoritative Store Ownership

Every core record has exactly one authoritative store at any time.
A record is authoritative in the store that accepts its reads and writes, and the other store must not be consulted for that record or re-authorize it.

The migration moved authority per record kind in dependency order while MongoDB writes remained enabled.
After a record kind was cut over, its MongoDB document was retained as unmodified recovery source until the retention window ended and was never read as a second authority.
The final retirement ended that retention on 2026-09-11; no repository code can read a retained document.

The retained-data contract moved every record kind that remained in MongoDB at core cutover into PostgreSQL.
No retained MongoDB document remained a second account authority once its kind was cut over.
After account cutover, the MongoDB `users` document was retained only as unmodified recovery source: profile reads and writes went to PostgreSQL, the retained document was never read or written at runtime, and no retained document could create, merge, rename, or authorize an account.
The final retirement removed that recovery source, so a verified PostgreSQL backup is the only recovery artifact.

## Field Ownership Inventory

The inventory names every persisted field the server reads or writes, its concept, its authoritative store after cutover, and its PostgreSQL destination.
A field listed as `payload` is stored inside the JSONB payload of its PostgreSQL table and keeps its existing JSON shape.
A field listed as a planned table or column is owned by the named later subtask and is recorded here so the boundary is fixed before implementation.

### Accounts And Profiles

| MongoDB field            | Concept            | After cutover | PostgreSQL destination                       | Notes                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users._id`              | Account identity   | PostgreSQL    | `platform_identities.external_user_id` (hex) | Runtime mapping key; unique; one identity per legacy account. |
| `users.email`            | Profile            | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.email` (TASK-0190.02)              | Case-insensitive sign-in lookup is preserved.                 |
| `users.firstName`        | Profile            | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.first_name` (TASK-0190.02)         |                                                               |

| `users.picture`          | Profile            | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.picture` (TASK-0190.02)            | Calendar-account pictures remain integration data.            |
| `users.hasCustomName`    | Profile preference | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.has_custom_name` (TASK-0190.02)    | Preserves absent versus `false`.                              |
| `users.timezoneOffset`   | Profile preference | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.timezone_offset` (TASK-0190.02)    | Also feeds retained daily-log bucketing.                      |
| `users.numEventsCreated` | Usage counter      | PostgreSQL    | `accounts.num_events_created` (TASK-0190.02) | Create paths increment it.                                    |

### Calendar Integration Records

These fields stayed in MongoDB until the retained-data cutover and were never account authority.
They are keyed by the same legacy account identity and resolve it through `platform_identities.external_user_id`.
[PostgreSQL Retained-Data Migration Contracts](postgres-retained-data-contracts.md) records their PostgreSQL destinations.

### Events

Common event fields apply to every event kind.
The PostgreSQL `postgres_events.type` check constraint currently admits only `specific_dates` and `dow`, so TASK-0190.04 and TASK-0190.05 must extend the accepted kinds before group and signup rows are written.

## Legacy Identity Resolution

### Accounts

`platform_identities.external_user_id` is the sole runtime mapping between a legacy MongoDB account and its PostgreSQL account, and it holds the hexadecimal MongoDB `users._id`.
Account migration is idempotent through `FindOrCreatePlatformIdentity`, so repeated backfill cannot create a duplicate identity for the same legacy account.
Distinct MongoDB accounts remain distinct PostgreSQL accounts even when their emails compare equal, because merging accounts would infer an identity the source does not establish.
Sessions remain cookie-held `userId` hexadecimal values and resolve the PostgreSQL account through this mapping without a session data migration.

### Account Lookup Behavior

Account profile and existence lookups read the authoritative PostgreSQL account only.
When the PostgreSQL pool is deliberately uninitialized, because `POSTGRES_APPLICATION_URI` is unset and the application never calls `postgres.Init`, those lookups report no account.
A lookup that fails for any reason other than a genuine no-row result is reported as an error, and a genuine no-row result means the account is absent.
No legacy `users` document is consulted for account authority.

### Migrated Records

Migrated events, responses, blocks, attendees, folders, and memberships receive new PostgreSQL identities.
All relationships among migrated records are rewritten in the same migration transaction, so no permanent legacy-identifier lookup table is exposed at runtime and no compatibility redirect exists for old public event URLs.
Public event URLs may stop resolving or resolve to a different identifier after cutover, and the frontend treats the PostgreSQL identifier as the canonical one.
The migration used a temporary, migration-scoped ledger keyed by the legacy MongoDB identifier to achieve resumability and idempotency; the ledger is operational tooling, is not read by request paths, and is dropped after cutover validation.

### Retained MongoDB References

Retained `dailyuserlogs.userIds[]` values stayed as legacy account identifiers and resolved through `platform_identities.external_user_id` at their explicit boundary.
Retained calendar integration documents were matched to their account by the same mapping.
No retained document could create an account, merge two accounts, or authorize a request.
The final retirement removed the retained documents, so no repository boundary resolves them now.

## Authority Preservation And Quarantine

### Legacy Guest Credentials

Legacy MongoDB `guestEditToken` values authorized a single legacy response under legacy MongoDB semantics and were not imported into PostgreSQL as authority.
Migrated guest responses are owned by a fresh Event Visitor Identity but receive no base [Event Visitor Control Credential (EVCC)](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-control-credential-evcc) and no [Event Owner Edit Token](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner-edit-token).
Each quarantined credential was recorded in the migration ledger with the legacy response identity, event identity, quarantine reason, and migration batch, so the loss was auditable and recoverable by re-running from the then-untouched MongoDB source; the backfill tooling and retained source were retired on 2026-09-11.
A guest whose legacy token is quarantined regains PostgreSQL response authority only by establishing new authority, such as creating a new response or associating an existing identity through [Event Sign-In](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-sign-in), and never by presenting the legacy token.

### Ambiguous Ownership

Ambiguous records are quarantined and reported rather than repaired by inference.
No migration step may promote a legacy response credential into event ownership, convert a legacy guest credential into a PostgreSQL credential, or assign an event to an account that the source does not already associate.

At minimum, the following conditions are quarantined with distinct reason codes:

| Reason code                  | Condition                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `missing-owner-account`      | An event `ownerId` has no resolvable MongoDB user.                                          |
| `incomplete-token-ownership` | A response has `guestOwnershipMode = "token"` but is missing `guestId` or `guestEditToken`. |
| `missing-response-identity`  | A response has neither a resolvable account reference nor a usable guest identity.          |
| `invalid-guest-name`         | A guest response fails the shared guest-name normalizer.                                    |
| `orphan-response`            | A response references an event that is absent or unmigratable.                              |
| `orphan-membership`          | Folder membership references an absent folder or event.                                     |

### Owner Authority

Ownership already associated through a creator [Event Visitor Identity](../../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-visitor-identity) migrates to `postgres_events.owner_platform_identity_id`.
Older anonymous events carry no recoverable owner edit token, so without an existing ownership association their settings, archive state, and deletion remain unmanageable in PostgreSQL after cutover.
Existing base credentials are never promoted to owner authority, and ownership takeover and protected mutations continue to serialize under the event row lock.

## Backfill And Cutover Contract

### Migration Units And Ordering

A migration unit is one aggregate copied atomically: an account and its retained integration pointer, an event with its responses, an availability group with its attendees, or a folder with its memberships.
Units are migrated in dependency order: accounts, then events and their responses and attendees and signup data, then folders and folder memberships.
Calendar, OTP, friend-request, and daily-log collections are never copied in this migration.

### Resumability And Idempotency

Each unit is written in a single PostgreSQL transaction that also records completion in the migration ledger.
Re-running the migration re-reads the ledger, skips completed units, and re-inserts or upserts incompletely committed units without creating duplicates, relying on `external_user_id` uniqueness for accounts and ledger-recorded target identities for migrated aggregates.
Interruption at any point leaves completed units committed and the next run resumes from the first incomplete unit.

### Concurrent Writes And Freeze

The initial backfill ran in batches while the application continued to serve MongoDB, and a bounded catch-up pass re-read changed source records so that edits made during backfill were copied.
After catch-up, the application entered a short write freeze for the migrating record kind in which new mutations were rejected or queued and not dual-written.
During the freeze the migration performed a final idempotent pass, ran reconciliation, and only then switched reads and writes for that record kind to PostgreSQL.
The freeze ended when the kind was authoritative in PostgreSQL.
No permanent dual write existed, and no record is authored in two stores after its cutover.

### Reconciliation Checks

Reconciliation runs before each cutover and records its evidence in the migration ledger and runbook.
Checks compare source and target by unit and include:

- Per-kind row counts and per-event response counts, including `num_responses` equality.
- Referential integrity: every response, attendee, signup response, and folder membership resolves to a migrated event or account.
- Uniqueness: exactly one `platform_identities.external_user_id` per legacy account and no duplicate event short identifiers.
- Relationship equality for ownership associations, folder membership, signup block membership, and attendee decline state.
- Payload equality for dates, active slots, availability, if-needed availability, manual availability, timezone, and recurrence, at millisecond precision.
- Timestamp and lifecycle equality for creation time, archive state, and soft-delete state.
- Quarantine totals and reason-code breakdown.

### Representative Fixtures

The migration ships a representative fixture set that exercises each migrated concept and each quarantine path:

1. An anonymous timed event with protected and open guest responses.
2. An anonymous dates-only event with responses.
3. A day-of-week event.
4. An authenticated timed event with an owner account and account responses.
5. An availability group with active and declined attendees and calendar-derived availability.
6. A signup form with multiple blocks, capacity limits, and account and guest signups.
7. A folder with member events the account owns and has responded to.
8. A retained calendar-integration account with provider tokens and calendar preferences.
9. Quarantine records for each reason code above.

### Interruption Recovery

Recovery is replay from the ledger, not manual repair.
A partially written aggregate is rolled back by its transaction boundary, completed aggregates are skipped, and the quarantine ledger is append-only so replayed runs preserve the same quarantine decisions.

### Rollback Boundaries

Before a kind's cutover, rollback was trivial: MongoDB remained unmodified and authoritative, and disabling the PostgreSQL route for that kind returned to MongoDB.
After a kind's cutover, the write freeze was the practical point of no return because mutations accepted by PostgreSQL are not dual-written, so a MongoDB rollback would have lost post-cutover writes unless they were exported back.
The schema is additive and never dropped during migration, destructive downgrades are refused, and MongoDB source documents were retained unmodified until the retention window and final validation completed.
The final retirement on 2026-09-11 removed the MongoDB read path and credentials, so no record kind can return to MongoDB and a verified PostgreSQL backup is the only repository-supported recovery artifact.
The staging and production runbook records the exact cutover gate, retention window, backup and restore procedure, and the handling of quarantined records that remain unresolved at cutover.

## Deferred Implementation Details

The following are intentionally left to later subtasks and are not decided here: concrete DDL and constraints for accounts, folders, signup blocks, signup responses, attendees, and groups; fixture and migration tooling; reconciliation tooling; and the operational runbook.
Those subtasks must obey the store boundary, identity mapping, quarantine rules, and cutover and rollback limits in this contract.
