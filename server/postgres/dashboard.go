// DashboardEvent pairs an account-visible event with whether the account owns
// it, whether the account has responded to it, and whether the account is a
// non-declined group member. A responded-but-not-owned event still appears on
// the dashboard, and only owned events carry owner authority. Responded is
// derived from response storage so a group invitee without a response stays in
// the pending state, and Member lets the dashboard derive group responded state
// the same way the attendee lookup does.

// ListDashboardEvents returns every non-deleted event the account owns, has
// responded to, or is invited to as a group attendee. Ownership resolves
// through the event's platform-identity or external owner reference. A
// response counts when it names the account directly or when its Event Visitor
// Identity is associated with the account's platform identity, so a signed-in
// response is recovered from the session alone. Group membership resolves by
// the account's email against non-declined attendees. A group invitee keeps
// their pending state until they respond. Every entry comes from PostgreSQL
// event storage, so callers receive one deduplicated list.
